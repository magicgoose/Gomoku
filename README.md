The goal of the project is achieved. Some bugs are still there, though - I'll fix them if I'll have time to do it. For now I must concentrate on other things.

The entry point is src/magicgoose/gomoku/gui/GomokuMainWindow.scala/GomokuMainWindow.main(args: Array[String]). There is no external dependencies. I'm using Scala 2.10.
